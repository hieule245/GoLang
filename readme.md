# Golang Basic Web 
This project is a learning exercise in building a web application using Golang. It explores key web development concepts such as routing, middleware, CSRF protection, and session management. The project includes simple pages, middleware for logging and security, and will eventually incorporate forms and dynamic data handling. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with Go's net/http package and best practices for structuring a Go web application.
